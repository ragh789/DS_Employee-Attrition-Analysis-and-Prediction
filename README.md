# DS_Employee-Attrition-Analysis-and-Prediction
The project predicts whether an employee will stay or leave a company using HR dataset employee_attrition.csv.We started with EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand patterns in attrition, age, salary, overtime, and other factors.Preprocessing included encoding categorical features (like Gender, OverTime) and scaling numeric features using StandardScaler.The preprocessed dataset was saved as employee_attrition_preprocessed.csv for future use.We split the data into train and test sets to evaluate models fairly.Models tested: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
We compared models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC.Random Forest was chosen as the best model and saved as best_attrition_model.pkl.Supporting files saved: scaler.pkl, categorical_features.pkl, feature_names.csv for consistent preprocessing in deployment.A Streamlit app was built where HR managers can input employee details and get a risk score + prediction (stay  or leave ).
